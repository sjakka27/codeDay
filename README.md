# codeDay
Project for CodeDay12 in Chicago

We created a webapp that allows users to upload a picture, then leverages Google's Vision API to analyze the objects in the photo and provide links on where similar objects can be bought. 

We used Apache Cordova to create a mobile app version of our project.
